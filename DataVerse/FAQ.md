## What is DataVerse? 

 Dataverse is a free and open source software platform for publishing, citing, and preserving research data. Dataverse was developed by the Institute for [Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS)](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Dataverse is interoperable with other Dataverse installations and systems (like Open Journal Systems), providing opportunities for greater reuse of data.

## What is UCLA DataVerse?

UCLA Dataverse is a platform for publishing and archiving datasets (and other data products) created by faculty, staff, and students at UCLA.  The repository is built in an open­source application called Dataverse, originally developed and used by Harvard University.

## What's the Difference Between a Dataverse and a Dataset?

A **dataverse** is a container for datasets (research data, code, documentation, and metadata) and other dataverses, which can be setup for individual researchers, departments, journals and organizations. A researcher uses UCLA Dataverse can create a dataverse as an area to collect all their datasets. They then become the administrators of that dataverse, with the ability to change to customize the logo and description of that dataverse, control access restrictions to the dataverse, create templates for datasets deposited there, and create guestbooks to track who downloads their datasets.

## How do I get started? 

1. Log in to **<https://dataverse.ucla.edu>** using your UCLA Logon ID. You’ll see a drop down menu where you can select UCLA.
1. Create a **new “dataverse”** for collecting all your datasets in a single place. A **dataverse** is a container for collecting multiple datasets or studies. Think of it as a *vita* for your datasets.
1. Add a **dataset** that can include multiple files such as data files, code and supplementary materials.
1. To help others discover and understand the data, provide some information about what you’ve uploaded in the forms provided.
1. Select save and then publish. Or, if you would like to restrict access to the data, you can share only with a select few.
