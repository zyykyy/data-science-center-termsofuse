# Policies

- [Collection Policy](#collection-policy)
- [Preservatoin](#preservation) 
- [Terms of Use](#terms-of-use)

These are the policies for UCLA Dataverse. NOTE: these policies are subject to change.


## Collection Policy

## Preservation

### Content
-------

* Scope: We allow all research objects created from research and educational projects at UCLA to be made publicly available, discoverable, linkable, and ultimately, reusable.
* Stage of research data:  Data from any stage of the research lifecycle is accepted
* Eligibility: You are a faculty member, staff member, or student and have a UCLA Logon ID
* Rights: By uploading content, no change of ownership is implied and no property rights are transferred to the UCLA Library. All uploaded content remains the property of the parties prior to submission
* Data file formats: All formats are allowed - even preservation unfriendly. Dataverse will convert certain tabular data formats (Stata, XLS, R, SPSS) into plane-text tab delimited files.
* Volume and size limitations: Total files size limit per record is 50GB. Higher quotas can be requested and granted on a case-by-case basis.
* Data quality: All information is provided **as-is**, and the user holds UCLA and information providers supplying data to UCLA free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.
* Metadata types and sources:
* Licenses: Users must specify a license for all publicly available files. Licenses for closed access files may be specified in the description field.


### How do I know I am ready to deposit?
------------------------------------

* All confidential, restricted, legally protected, and/or private content (e.g. personally identifiable information) has been removed from your data, and the data is sufficiently anonymized/de-identified
*  Your data is organized logically and coherently
* Your data is documented and described sufficiently for purposes of discovery and reuse
* Your have the rights to publish your data and/or have received permission from other rights-holders

### What are the restrictions?
-----------------------------

* Deposits must contain unrestricted content with no private, confidential, or otherwise legally restricted information.  If applicable, data should be de-identified and anonymized.
* The depositor should hold rights to the deposited data, or have permission of the owner to share it.
* UCLA Dataverse repository adheres to the University of California [copyright and fair use policies](http://www.library.ucla.edu/support/publishing-data-management/scholarly-communication-resources-education/ucla-library-copyright-policy/uc-systemwide-copyright-policies) articulated by the Regents of UC.
* Data files deposited in UCLA Dataverse must include descriptive metadata to facilitate discovery.
* A long-term contact person who is familiar with the data must be designated at the time of deposit.
* Data should be in their final state, and not subject to future revisions.

### What types of data can be deposited?
------------------------------------

* Any data, such as data, text, software, scripts, data visualizations, etc. from any discipline may be deposited.
* UCLA Dataverse administrators do not attempt to judge the scholarly quality of deposited data;  this is the responsibility of the depositor.
* UCLA Dataverse administrators may may review data for alignment with deposit criteria and work with depositors to extend the descriptive metadata as required for discoverability,
* Where appropriate, UCLA Dataverse administrators will recommend (but not mandate) that data be deposited in formats that align with preservation best practices.


### Can deposits be escrowed/embargoed?
-----------------------------------

* Dataverse doesn't support escrowed/embargoed datasets (timed release), however, you can keep your data as a draft.


### After you deposit
------------------

* Each dataset will received a DOI that serves as a permanent link to that dataset.  In addition, UCLA Dataverse will register your descriptive metadata with the DataCite Metadata Store to enhance discoverability.
* Data published in UCLA Dataverse are discoverable and openly available to anyone with access to the Internet.
* In some specific cases, data may be withdrawn from UCLA Dataverse.  These include demonstrated copyright violation, violations of legal requirements, verified plagiarism, falsified research, and for reasons of National Security.  Withdrawn items are not deleted, but will be removed from public view. As appropriate, UCLA Dataverse will redirect DOI's for withdrawn items to "tombstone" sites which will contain details of the reason for the withdrawal, and provide links to replacement content if it is available.

### Preservation policy
-------------------

The UCLA Dataverse will store deposited data for a minimum of 10 years beyond the date of initial publication
UCLA Dataverse also currently commits to providing public access through maintenance of persistent UCLA Dataverse webpages, descriptive metadata records, and identifiers, as well as providing access metrics, which may include page-views, downloads, and citations.

All UCLA Dataverse content, both data and metadata, is backed up regularly according to current best practices.  Additionally, all UCLA Dataverse content is checksummed to ensure that file integrity is retained in the future.

rights to privacy.

### Rules and Conduct
-----------------------

As a condition of use, you promise not to use the Service for any
purpose that is prohibited by the Terms of Use. For purposes of the
Terms of Use, \"Content\" includes, without limitation, any information,
data, text, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features

### Registration
------------

As a condition to using Services, you may be required to register with
DSC via the Service and select a password and login name ("Service Login
Name"). You shall provide DSC with accurate, complete, and updated

### User Submissions
----------------

The Service provides you with the ability to upload, submit, disclose,
distribute or otherwise post (hereafter, \"posting\") Content
(including, without limitation, information, data, and images) to the
Service (\"User Submissions\") and to allow other users to do so. The
Service provides you with the ability to display, organize, and accept
Content through creation of a Dataverse.

The Service also provides you with the ability to post User Submissions
to other Dataverses administered by third parties (\"Third-Party
Dataverse Administrator\"), subject to the permissions and terms of use
required by those Third-Party Dataverse Administrators. User Submissions
posted to Third-Party Dataverse Administrators are also subject to
curation by the Third-Party Dataverse Administrator for that Dataverse.
An important part of the mission of DSC is to acquire and preserve
research data and provide access to it. DSC is a member of the Data
Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences ("Data-PASS"), a
partnership of major social science data archives in the United States.
DSC intends to create archival versions of the Content that will
facilitate preservation, verification, management, and use, and to
permanently archive these versions of the Content at multiple locations.
DSC will use good archival practices, as identified by DSC and
Data-PASS, to retain and preserve Content deposited into the Site.
Notwithstanding, you acknowledge that DSC and Third-Party Dataverse
Administrators will not be liable for any loss of or damage to the User
Submissions, either in whole or in part.

Please be aware that DSC does not review User Submissions before they
are made available to the public, so we may only accept data that are
publicly distributable. BEFORE YOU CONTRIBUTE DATA TO DSC, YOU MUST
ENSURE THAT THE DATA MEET OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. If your data do not
meet our terms and conditions, DSC will be unable to accept your data.
You will be held legally and financially responsible for damages to DSC
if data you contribute violate these terms and conditions.

By posting User Submissions on or at the Site, or otherwise through the
Service, to your Dataverse or other Dataverses, or by allowing others to
do so, you make the following representations and warranties to DSC and
to the administrator of that Dataverse:

-   The User Submissions do not infringe upon the copyrights or other
    intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to patent,
    trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other
    right of any other person or of any other third party.
-   The User Submissions do not violate any laws, including but not
    limited to laws related to defamation or obscenity.
-   You will promptly notify both DSC and the administrator of the
    Dataverse curating the User Submissions of any confidentiality,
    privacy or data protection, licensing, or intellectual property
    issues regarding the User Submissions.
-   The User Submissions do not contain software viruses or any other
    computer codes, files, or programs that are designed or intended to
    disrupt, damage, limit or interfere with the proper function of any
    software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment or to damage or
    obtain unauthorized access to any system, data or other information
    of DSC or any third party.
-   You acknowledge that DSC will not be liable for any loss of or
    damage to the User Submissions, either in whole or in part.
-   If the User Submission is subject to IRB review, the User
    Submissions were given IRB approval.

The Service gives the Dataverse owner the ability to restrict access to
User Submissions to specified user accounts (\"Restricted User
Submissions\"). Third-Party Dataverse Administrators may also choose to
restrict certain User Submissions in accordance with their own terms of
use. All other User Submissions shall be deemed openly accessible to the
public, or "Unrestricted." By posting User Submissions on or at the
Site, or otherwise through the Service, to your Dataverse or other
Dataverses, or by allowing others to do so, you make the following
representations and warranties to DSC and to the administrator of that
Dataverse:

The User Submissions do not contain information that could directly or
indirectly identify the subject except where the release of such
identifying information has no potential for constituting an unwarranted
invasion of privacy, a breach of confidentiality, or a violation of any
applicable law. This includes, but is not limited to, the removal of any
information subject to European Union data protection law or equivalent
contractual restrictions on the use of data concerning a person in or
from the European Union. In addition, for all personally identifiable
information in the data, at least one of following conditions applies:

-   This information has been previously released to the public
-   This information describes public figures, where the data relates to
    their public roles or other non-sensitive subjects
-   A sufficient length of time has passed since the collection of the
    information so that the data can be considered \"historic\"
-   All identified or identifiable subjects have given explicit informed
    consent allowing the public release of all of the information in the
    dataset
-   All information was collected with an explicit statement concerning
    the public nature of the data, such as information collected for
    certain governmental regulatory purposes
-   For federal records (data created by a U.S. federal government
    agency or under a federal contract) only, all identified or
    identifiable subjects are deceased and no federal statute explicitly
    restricts the release of the data
-   You give permission and any required licenses to DSC to make the
    Content available for archiving, preservation and access, within
    Data-PASS including, without restriction, permission:
-   To re-disseminate copies of the User Submissions in a variety of
    distribution formats according to the standard terms of use of UCLA
    Dataverse
-   To promote and advertise the User Submissions in any publicity (in
    any form) for Data-PASS and the UCLA Dataverse
-   To describe, catalog, validate and document the User Submissions
-   To store, translate, copy or re-format the User Submissions in any
    way to ensure their future preservation and accessibility, improve
    usability and/or protect respondent confidentiality
-   To incorporate metadata (cataloging information) or documentation in
    the User Submission into public access catalogues

You shall not provide DSC with any confidential or proprietary
information that you desire or are required to keep secret. You are
solely responsible for the User Submissions you post on or through the
Service. DSC does not endorse and has no control over any User
Submission. DSC has no obligation to monitor the Site, Service, Content,
or User Submissions. DSC may remove any User Submission at any time for
any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or
allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such User
Submission), or for no reason at all. You represent and warrant that you
are lawfully entitled and have full authority to license DSC to use the
User Submission in the ways described in these Terms and Conditions; and
you are not under any obligation or restriction created by law, contract
or otherwise that would prevent you from entering into and fully
performing these Terms and Conditions.
